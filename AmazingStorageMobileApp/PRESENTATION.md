### Components:

1. **Mobile Frontend**: React Native + Expo
   - Responsive UI
   - Cross-platform compatibility (iOS/Android)
   - Secure local storage
   
2. **API Integration**: 
   - RESTful API communication
   - JSON data exchange
   - Token-based authentication
   
3. **Backend Connection**:
   - Connects to our distributed storage system
   - Utilizes existing API endpoints
   - Maintains same security standards

## Key Features Demonstration

### 1. File Management
- View all files in the distributed storage system
- Sort and filter files by name, size, or date
- Get detailed file information

### 2. Upload Capabilities
- Select files from device storage or other apps
- Progress tracking during uploads
- Support for all file types

### 3. Download Functionality
- Download files to local device
- Open files with appropriate applications
- Save files for offline access

### 4. Security Implementation
- Secure authentication
- Encrypted data transfer
- Token management

### 5. User Experience
- Intuitive interface
- Bottom navigation for easy access
- Consistent with web interface but optimized for mobile

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Technologies:
- **React Native**: Cross-platform mobile framework
- **Expo**: Development toolchain 
- **Axios**: API communication
- **Expo Vector Icons**: UI elements

### Backend Integration:
- Utilizes the same REST API as the web interface
- Endpoints for file operations (CRUD)
- Background synchronization capabilities

### Security Measures:
- HTTPS for all communications
- JWT token authentication
- Secure storage for credentials

1. **Login Screen**
   - Enter credentials
   - Authentication process
   
2. **File Browsing**
   - View list of all stored files
   - See file details
   
3. **Upload Process**
   - Select file from device
   - Upload progress
   - Confirmation of successful storage
   
4. **File Operations**
   - Download to device
   - Share with others
   - Delete unwanted files

## Advantages Over Web Interface

1. **Native Device Integration**
   - Access device camera and files
   - Push notifications
